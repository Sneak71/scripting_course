## Try Linux on a VM

* [Simple guide to install Linux as Virtual Machine](https://www.storagecraft.com/blog/the-dead-simple-guide-to-installing-a-linux-virtual-machine-on-windows/)
* For Linux distro, you can check out a custom [Porteus](http://porteus.org/) build I made with addition of gvim, Perl, Python 2 and Python 3. It is a light weight distro, < 200MB ISO file (so, selecting RAM size of 512MB is enough for most purposes) and boots usually within 5 seconds
  * [Porteus_32bit.iso](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7SzVctdXWlUYy1QZG1NX2xyYVk)
  * [Porteus_64bit.iso](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7SzVctdXWlUV3kyNlhMU29PMUk)
  * Both the builds have a folder at `/tmp/useful_files/` which contains dot files (to be copied to home directory) and handful of Perl and Python 3 programs for learning purposes
  * The default passwords are `toor` for root and `guest` for guest — [Porteus FAQ](http://www.porteus.org/faq.html)
* If you get errors like **kernel panic**, you might have to [Enable Intel VT-x in Your Computer’s BIOS or UEFI Firmware](https://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/)

**Further Reading** Guide to choosing your Linux Distribution, installation, list of applications, etc
* [awesome-linux](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-linux#distributions)
* [computefreely](https://computefreely.org/)
* [Arch wiki: list of applications](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications)
